# 1. About

<a name='overview'></a>

## Project Overview (inspiration here?)

- ### Natural Selection Simulator is a customizable implementation of a genetic algorithm based on natural selection. Users will configure their own species of organisms and watch them ...
<br>

## Natural Selection and Genetic Algorithms

<br>

> ### *"Natural Selection is the process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. The theory of its action was first fully expounded by Charles Darwin and is now believed to be the main process that brings about evolution."*
>
> ### - [Oxford Languages](https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/)

<br>

## * 5 phases refer to genetic algorithms, NOT natural selection. <<< make that clear
### (describe how a genetic algorithm is just an optimization algorithm based on natural selection)
### (maybe include definition of GA, as well as GA/SGA vs EA)
### (describe 5 phases of gemetic algorithm) * Don't forget roulette wheel selection!

## [Installation Instructions (needs tag)]

## [web server explanation and instructions/recommendations]

<a name='walkthrough'></a>

# 3. Walkthrough? (may need better name; "Implementation?")

## (Simulation types description)

## The Algorithm

- #### (describe how settings allow user to configure their own simulation) (maybe show at end to not overwhelm user)

- #### (show code / images / gifs for all 5 phases)

### Simulation Type: Classic

- #### describe classic sim type

### Simulation Type: Boundary

- #### describe boundary sim type

# 4. Final/Closing Thoughts

- ### (describe how the algorithm is trivial compared to real natural selection)

- ### What can we take away from this project?

- ### etc.

# 5. Author

- ### (talk about myself)
- ### (email/contact)
